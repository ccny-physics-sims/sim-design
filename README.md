Instructions:

Edit the `sims-styles.css` file to alter the appearance and behavior of standard html elements.

Include class definitions like:

```
.sim-button {
border: thick solid red;
}
```

which can be applied to a button by adding `.class(the-class-name)`

```
button.class("sim-button");
```
